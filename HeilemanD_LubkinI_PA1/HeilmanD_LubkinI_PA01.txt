ONE:

a) openat(AT_FDCWD, "myTstFile", O_RDWR)   = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)

This is the command that tries to open the file and returns a failed condition

b) write(x , x, x)

It correlates with openat

d) print if is also not a system call because it is a c function. It correlates with write.
